    "description": "This is an application that converts text to image. We needed something like this at VEVO because one of the core fonts we used explicitly states that it cannot be embed using @font-face. We got around that by using this application which automatically generates images for text we needed. The app supports four different rendering providers: GDI+, WPF, ImageMagick and Pango. However, I am running this on Mono, which does not support WPF. And I did not want to install Pango on this server. since it is a very small cloud server.",

    "description": "Most online Sudoku solvers even today relied on server-side code or browser plugins do the actual solving. Around 2007 when I was in between jobs, I decided to create this Sudoku solver entirely in JavaScript with the goal of being able to solve all Sudoku puzzles.   I have implemented a number of human solving techniques. You can take any hard puzzles from the NYT or any other newspaper, and I am confident that this solver would solve it with no problem.   When all human techniques are exhausted, the script would then remodel the Sudoku as an Exact Cover problem. This allows the solver to solve in milliseconds puzzles that were designed to be impossible.   I did not use any third-party plugins for this when I developed it, so the older version of this solver actually works on IE5. I have however since updated to use require.js so that it is portable enough to work on node.js. ",

    "description": "Awhile back VEVO had explored creating an in-house recommendation. At the time, we did not have a readily available tracking data. I thought of the idea that we should use Playlist data as the basis for our recommendation. This prototype grew out of that. The engine calculates similarity using vector cosine. In vector space, the cosine between two vectors is a number between 0 and 1 that is directly proportional to the angle between the two vectors. I have since removed the SQL Server dependency by replacing it with a SQL CE instance. In addition, I have added a Silverlight and a WinForm GUI so that the users can easily query the results.",

    "description": "When VEVO was taking transcoding in-house, we used Handbrake CLI to handle transcoding of our videos. We had the need to find an alternative AAC encoder, because Handbrake used FAAC encoder on Windows/Linux which was very poor quality. The Core Audio from OS X was higher quality; however, OS X was not available as cloud instances, thus not scalable. I did the research and found that there were alternative encoders such as Nero AAC Encoder and QuickTime Encoder that were higher quality than FAAC. However, since Handbrake did not make encoder modular, I had to write a wrapper to mux and demux the streams for Handbrake. This Handbrake Wrapper does exactly that. In the end, we ended up using QuickTime because Nero was significantly more expensive.",

    "description": "Like many gamers of my age, I played World of Warcraft around 2005 and 2006. World of Warcraft supports the creation of add-ons through a Lua interface. During my tenure of playing that game, I took the opportunity to learn Lua and wrote a few add-ons. I have since quit the game, and given a lot of game mechanics have changed, I assume all of those add-ons no longer work.  ",
